If anybody wants to implement just the design part in CSS, you are more than welcome to contribute. It would be a big help.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome.

You can contribute to this project by forking the project, adding or making changes, and submitting a pull request.

## Disclaimer

I'm privating the backend repo because a lot of people are copying the project without giving any credits and pretending to be the real one. You can only test this on your localhost and cannot host it. It will give you CORS error.
